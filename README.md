This project aims to create an application for a gymnasium. 
Offering power bi reports for better understanding the progression of membership evolution and gym locations performance. 
A power apps app was developed both in mobile and tablet versions for management the gym daily work and its employes. 
A simple model drive app, based on Dataverse tables was also developed for temporary promotions.

A chatbot named Gymbot was developed, it can answer questions about gym schedules of the various locations, and it also has a small store selling supplies, the information being stored in a sharepoint list.
